# National-ID-Card-Recognition
Using Tesseract for National ID Card Recognition
## **Project Overview**

In this Capstone project, you'll embark on creating a National ID Card Recognition system using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology. The core of this project involves utilizing Tesseract OCR, a renowned open-source OCR engine, to accurately recognize and extract text from images of national ID cards. Additionally, OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library, will be employed to preprocess the images, enhancing their quality for better text recognition. This project aims to provide practical experience with OCR and computer vision techniques, which are pivotal in the realm of artificial intelligence.


## **Key Components**
* Tesseract OCR: For the OCR process to recognize text from ID card images.
* OpenCV: To preprocess images, improving the OCR's accuracy.
* Techniques such as Find Contours will be used to isolate the ID card in the image, adjust its perspective, and enhance its readability.


  ## **Project Goals**

* Develop a generic codebase capable of handling various formats of national ID cards.
* Preprocess images using OpenCV to optimize them for text recognition.
* Use Tesseract OCR to extract text from preprocessed images.
* Structure the extracted text into a readable and organized format using a pandas DataFrame.
